# Video Game Search
An array is pre-loaded with video-game related search terms. Additional search terms may be added to this array by the user. This array dynamically creates alphabetically sorted buttons. Clicking a button will send an ajax call to Giphy using their API to return still images of gifs found by that search term. Clicking a gif will animate the gif.

## Getting Started

Click a button to see gifs related to that term. Enter the name of a new video game to create a new button! Have fun :)
